<h1 align="center">Wallet Management</h1>
<h2> Introduction</h2>
As-Salamu Alaikum. Welcome to the official repository of Wallet Management application.</br>

1. To run the application we need to first set up the database system. To do so please create a schema named `project` in your MySQL Workbench.</br>
2. Then run the sql script (database.sql) to create different tables that will be used to store the data.</br>
3. After doing so, please change the `USER` and `PASS` from the `src/main/java/com/example/newproject/SQLConnection.java`.
4. Don't forget to add the required `.jar` files.

5. If the schema is created by a different name then please change the `URL` in `src/main/java/com/example/newproject/SQLConnection.java` and replace `project` with your given schema name.
